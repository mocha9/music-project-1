# Project 1 

## Step 1 - Downloading the Template

- Fork the Project 1 repository, save it to the desktop
- Open the forked project in Sublime Text
- You should have an html file and an audio file

## Step 2 - Setting up your page

Add the basic structure to your page. You will need the following:
  - [ ] heading tag
  - [ ] audio tag (a source mp3 has been provided)
  - [ ] 4 buttons (play, pause, mute and unmute)

 ## Step 3 - Hook up your controls!

  - Create event listeners for each of the buttons. When clicked, they should call the appropriate method or set the necessary property on the audio tag
  - List of methods and properties: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp
  - EXTRA CHALLENGE: Can you create a function to set the event listeners? The function would take in the ID of your button element, and do something based on that ID. 

  ## Step 4 - Make it look GOOOD!

  - Add styles to your page, find custom buttons and make it look GOOOOOD!

  ## Step 5 - Above and Beyond

  - Can you create a better volume control? Instead of mute (0) and unmute (1), create a slider that can set the volume to any point between 0 and 1.
  - Can you create a scrubber for the track, so the user can jump to the halfway point, or end?
